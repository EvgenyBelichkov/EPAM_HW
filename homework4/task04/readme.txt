If you want run doctest you should take next steps:
 - If you don't have Python on your PC - install Python 3.8 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - Open terminal
 - Install pytest (pip install pytest)
 - Clone the repository  (git clone https://github.com/EvgenyBelichkov/EPAM_HW.git)
 - Change directory from your current directory to '.../EPAM_HW/homework4/task04'
 - Run Python with fizz_buzz_numbers.py (write in terminal: 'python3 fizz_buzz_numbers.py')
 - Pass -v to the script, and doctest prints a detailed log of what itâ€™s trying, and prints a summary at the
   end (write in terminal: 'python3 fizz_buzz_numbers.py -v')
